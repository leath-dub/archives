                        Hey! my name is Cathal, I was born in Dublin and have stayed here my entire life.
                        I am currently in 3rd level education studying computer science in DCU. I love
                        college and I find the course very intelectually stimulating. Apart from 
                        education I spend my free time doing the following.
                            <li>Programming</li>
                            <li>Linux(if you can call it a hobby)</li>
                            <li>Mechanical Keyboards</li>
                            <li>Cycling</li>
                            <li>Video Games</li>
                        </p>
                        <p id="about-content">
                        Overall I can be quite introverted, but despite this I tend to get along with 
                        people and when it comes to group excercises I always push my weight.
                        </p>

                        <p id="about-content">
                        Unfortunately I dont have much work experience only about 2 months in total and I did those in transition year.
                        I worked with the office of the DPP(Director of Public Prosecutions) for a few weeks, in which I learned a lot
                        about the courts system observing the process every day. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="about-content">
                        I also had payed work for a mureal project, in which my friends and I painted a wall of Baldoyle S.N.S. 
                        This went surprisingly well and the weeks of effort seemed worth it when I saw the end result( refer to images ).
                        </p>
                        <p id="about-content">
                        I spent a couple weeks in the IT department of my uncles work place. There I helped with computer problems and
                        also general jobs you'd expect to be given to TY students. I also was shown around the  sever room and learnt 
                        about the hardware. It was this experience that prompted me to build a pc of my own.
                        </p>
                        <p id="about-content">
                        Finally I spent time in an advertising agency for another few weeks. Apart going through manuals and checking 
                        for inconsistencies, I also helped a coleague with a logo design and colour scheme for their client at the 
                        time.
