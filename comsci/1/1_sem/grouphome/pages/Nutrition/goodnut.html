                <p class="pt">
                Im sure nobody will argue the need for food as humans. However there is the question of what food.
                Nutrition is simply a process of nourishment, allowing organisms to grow and produce energy. By the
                simple fact that it is so key to our normal bodily function, you should feel the need to consider 
                what nutrition you are gaining from the foods that you are eating.

                <p class="pt">
                You might believe that being slim and not over eating classifies one as a healthy individual. But 
                this couldn't be further from the truth, your body needs more than just pure calories for ample 
                sustenance. In fact your body needs a mix of energy(calories), minerals and vitamins. You may have
                heard of the latter before, but didnt quite understand their importance. They are basically 
                components of food that our body needs for growth and repair, I discuss them more in detail
                along with minerals in this article <a href="vitamins.html">here</a>

                <h2>Reap the rewards</h2>
                <p class="pt">
                Regardless of whether you are an athlete or someone who sits around all day, the benifits of good
                nutrition are imense. When you provide your body with what it needs, you are rewarded with lower
                risk of disease, general livelyness, improved cognition and higher life expectancy. With the mentioned
                you will feel more equip in whatever work or studies you partake in.

                <p class="pt">
                Its not easy to change your entire diet and drastic change like this almost always fails. You need to take it
slow and start eating healthy options for foods you may already be eating. Whether it a placebo or not, upon eating
more fruit and vegatables and healthier food in general, you will feel fresh and energized and motivated to continue.
