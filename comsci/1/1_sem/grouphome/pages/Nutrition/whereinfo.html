                <h2>Preface</h2>
                The internet is great, you have access to a mass of information at you fingertips.
                However the sources of information are not made equal and the internet is ridden 
                with miss information and bad advice.
                <p> 
                I must preface that I am not qualified to give nutritional advice and this article
                will only comprise information found from cited, reputable sources. The most 
                important take away from this article is to question sources and try to extract 
                evidence based advice on your health and nutrition. Another thing to note is that
                only health advice does not substitute the need for a certified nutritionist, this is always
                superior as we our biased in what information we take away from websites.

                <h2>Who to Trust</h2>
                How to determine if an article/source is trusted? This is a really important 
                question when looking for advice about health. I personally follow a simple and
                intuitive list of questions you can ask yourself:

                                <li>Acknowledge this and ensure even more careful thought on the questions in this list</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="fw-bold pt">Is the articles website trusted to provide empirical scientific information?</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none;">

                                <li>Does it look like much thought was given to the article?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                Apart from the above, you could also more simply only consider advice or information
                from trusted sites that I personally use, of course you should make the decision on
                whether my choice of sites are reasonable. Nonetheless the following will comprise such
                sites, along with what information they are good for providing.
                </p>
                <hr class="my-5">
                <h2>World Health Organization</h2>
                <p>
                The World Health Organization has a tonne of information on various topics involving nutrition as well as
                health in general. They also reference studies involving such topics to provide an empiracal viewpoint.
                If I were to choose one site that I could trust information from it would be them.
                Their home page can be found here:

                Harvard college is a very reputable and prestigious source of information. They provide some
                great objective guidlines to nutrition and health and do research in the field.

                <h2>Trinity</h2>
                <p class="pt">
                If you are a fellow Irish citizen you probably dont need introduction to Trinity. It
                is a great college that's research is funded by the Irish Research Council. They 
                research some very important areas like "Nutrition in Inflamation and Immunity", 
                "Nutrition and Aging" and "Malnutrition".
                Their home page can be found here:

                The above are just the places that I personally trust, of course you can find other
                sources of Nutritional/Health information. It is important that you keep a record of
                sites that you have "whitelisted" for providing good information.
