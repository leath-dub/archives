# Probability Theory

- Events are subsets of the sample space 
    e.g, on roll of die, 5 comes up, we get an even number, we get a number > X

- Power set of omega is all of the events 
    null set is the impossible event 
    omega is the certain event

- if A and B = null set; they are mutually exclusive
