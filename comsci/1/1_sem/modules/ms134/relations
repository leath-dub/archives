Relations:
    
    A relation in the context of set theory is denoted by R, such that
    R is a subset of a sets A x B. R can be thought of as the set of 
    relations between give sets A and B.

        - We can find how many relations there are between any given sets
        by finding the cardinality of the power set P(A x B), such that
        |P(A x B)| = 2^(|A|.|B|)

        - We can form a relationship matrix with use of proposition to
        extract concrete T or F values to each relationship:
            
            e.g. A = {1,2,3} B = {1,3,5}, P(x,y): x <= y
                
                since we know there will be 9(|A|x|B| relations of 2 elements
                one from A, one from B.

                                    1 3 5 -- 
                        (T-T-T)   1 T T T  |--< co-ordinate version 
                        (F-T-T)   2 F T T  | 
                        (F-T-T)   3 F T T --

        - Relations can be combined using set operators to create more 
        complext relationships. Here is an example of a 2 dimensional 
        relationship of x and y. (x,y) element of R if and only if x is 
        older than y. Also (x,y) element of S if and only if x is a sibling
        of y. We can write the relationship (x,y) element of SnR; if and 
        only if x is an older sibling of y. *note if we want to reverse 
        the relationship we can use the notation R^-1.
