Introduction
------------

This document comprises two reflective sections an **individual reflection**
and a **group project reflection**. This module has focused on problem solving
but also on our education in general, I learnt how to work in a group and solve
problems behind a deadline. I felt the focus of this module on both our time in
college and outside in the workplace and in this way I felt driven to apply
myself as much as possible. In general I am excited to bring what I have learnt
from this module and apply it to next semester modules, as well as work
down the line. Reflection is key to self improvement and the following
will hopefully demonstrate this.

Individual Reflection Section
-----------------------------
_words: 688_\
_chosen topics of discussion: Decision Making, Problem Solving_

### 1. Reflection on my Decision Making

Early on in the semester my group and I were assigned a decision making task.
In the task we had to decide on the most appropriate method of communication ,
this would be achieved using a decision making grid. The decision making grid
we used is **table 1.0**. It was a formality for me at the time, as I had already
ignorantly made my mind up before starting the grid. Along with my
group I felt I put little effort into assigning the proper weightings and
scores and we were biased towards what we had priorly decided on( Instagram ). 

                                    Table 1.0

| Factors    | Accessibility | Efficiency    | Frequency     | Popularity    | Total  |
|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Weight     | 5             | 4             | 3             | 2             |        |
|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Instagram  | 20            | 20            | 15            | 10            | 65     | 
| Skype      | 10            | 12            | 0             | 2             | 14     |
| Discord    | 15            | 20            | 6             | 6             | 47     |
| Email      | 25            | 4             | 9             | 6             | 44     |

I do however feel in general I have improved in my decision making and I now
see a grid like the above as a useful tool in making a decision. I will now
describe what I should continue, stop and start in regards to my decision 
making up to this point.

### Continue

**using decision making grids:** I applied this tool specifically in another
assignment, the screencast project. My group members and I had collaborated two
problems, of which we needed to choose one of that we would solve. I did out a
decision making grid, which allowed me to slow down and rationalise what was
most important. I felt I had a more unequivocal idea of what was the right
choice.

### Stop

**letting time pressure skew my sense of reasoning:** Although under no time
constraints I am able to use a grid like before. In exam situations I find my
thoughts jumbled and unclear. I noticed this in some of the problem solving
quizzes and I think it is a combination of stress and sense of urgency that
brings me to this irrational state. I need to remember to stay calm and not
rush solutions. 

### Start

**journaling thoughts:** I need to start appending to a journal daily. This
would allow me to manage my thoughts and better learn from any mistakes I may
have made during the day. Good decision making is a combination of using past
experience and assessing evidence[1] and a journal would allow me to
introspectively learn and gain experience.

### 2. Reflection on my Problem Solving 

A couple weeks into this module we were assigned our first group problem
solving task. There were two problems to be solved, employing the problem
solving strategies we were becoming familiar with. I personally fell into pit
holes for one of the problems and lacked enough testing of our solution for the
other. In general I have improved and will reflect on what I should continue,
stop and start in the following. 

### Continue

**practicing in-action reflection:** In group quizzes following the task above
I felt I did well in adapting to situations and keeping the group on track.
This allowed me to fail quick and efficiently attack the problems.

### Stop

**jumping right in:** I think it is an effect of bad habits and laziness that I
still do this. For example in web design I employed a trial and error method
which led to ugly and purely functional code. I need steps that I can fall back
on and re-anchor from.

### Start

**testing solutions more carefully:** Specifically in programming we have a
tool called einstein, **fig 1.0**. This is useful but tells you if your correct
or not. In this way it doesn't endorse proper testing and when it came to
problems solved in, for example, the end of semester individual problem solving
quizzes I often had a lack of confidence in solutions and didn't have the
experience to verify them with proper testing.

Group Project Reflection
------------------------
_words: 359_\
_chosen topics of discussion: Groupwork_

### Reflection on our Groupwork

Communication is the key issue we faced in our group. It was not clear to some
members what was expected of them and people sometimes forgot to mark work
completed in the workspace. For context we used Trello as a platform for task
management. I thought we worked very well together for the interim presentation
however work slowed down from that point on due to other assignments. In general
we could have had more scheduled regular meetings to keep the group on track.
The following reflects on what I should continue, stop and start in my future
group projects.

### Continue

**using a workspace:** The trello workspace we used for the group project
helped a lot in outlining to the other members what needed to be done. However
we were too provisional in assigning who was to do what and this meant that
people had to ask whether it was okay to work on something to ensure that work
was not being done twice. We should have put
more effort at the start in assigning work, this would have saved time in the
long run.

### Stop

**not communicating for a few days:** There were a few periods during the group
project in which there was little to no communication between us. Granted we
were getting the work done, however I feel we would have benefited from regular
check ups ensuring that people were keeping up to a certain standard of work.
As mentioned previously this could have been due to focus on other projects as
well. Nonetheless in the future I will ensure we are not disjoint and check up
every second day to review what is being done.

### Start

**assigning more specific tasks:** People are more inclined to get clear and
specific tasks completed. This was a problem as some of the tasks on our trello
board were very vague, e.g. **_"finish slides for screencast"_**. I think what
it comes down to is bad planning as a group. Down the line I will make sure
there is proper planning and clear goals lain out before we even think of
jumping in.

Conclusion
----------

This module has taught me a lot and made me more concious of myself. This
reflective piece has allowed me to review the past semester and highlight key
areas for improvement. In general I need to continue reflection, implement
changes discussed in the start sections and eliminate elements of the stop
sections. I will strive for self improvement and ensure that myself and whom
ever I may work with outputs the best work possible.
