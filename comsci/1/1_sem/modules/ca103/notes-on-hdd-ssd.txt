Elements of computer hardware
	
        # HDD

	Components of a HDD( hard disk drive )
		
		- Platter / disk: hdds can have multiple and they are comprised of a in
		  general aluminium / ceramic / glass with a superficial magnetic media
		  layer ontop
			=> it is this layer that can store the data in binary via magnetic
			   fields
		*Reference* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_platter
		
		- Actuator: the device that has an electronic moter used to stabilize and 
		  control the read and write heads( basically moves them to the working 
		  area)

		- The arm heads: these are typically placed just above the surface of the 
		  platter and are used to either convert electrical current into a magnetic,
		  that is in the case of writing, and convert magnetic fields into electrical
		  current in the case of reading. The way in which data is stored can be 
		  more simply demonstrated through the use of a diagram that can be seem 
		  below

		- Spindle: a simple electrical motor that spins the platters allowing for 
		  the read / write of data stored as strong magnetic fields 

	Benefits of hdd:
		- In general cheaper per bit storage capacity
		*Not as much a difference in recent times however
	
	Benefits of ssd;
		- Solid state, in its nature is more reliable( for the lack of moving parts )
		- More dureable, they were originally used in aircrafts for their resistence
		  to vibrations and forces.
		- Faster and less noisy
		- More fixable
		- Less power hungry! they are more economic again due to the lack of moving 
		  parts
	
	# SSD

	Components of a SSD( solid state drive )

		- Controller: used as a interface between the pc and the storage area
		  it uses firware( code that is embedded into the hardware, ie not 
		  intalled on the operating system, it is likely your keyboard uses firware
		  to allow it to work on various different devices ). You can think of the 
		  controller as micro-processor, it allows for a host of reliability features
		  of which I wont dicuss lest I lose your attention.
		
		- The memory: this is the area that stores data, much like the hdd in binary 
		  form. The memory is comprised of many electronic chips known as trasistors
		  they can store data by the use of electronic switches that have to state 
		  on or off ( ie, 1 or 0 ) much like the areas of strong magnetic field were 
		  considered 1 and weak considered 0. Flash memory used in such storage 
		  areas is possible by being able to store electrons, unlike volitile memory
		  solutions that require constant power to store values( eg. ram )
		  when electrons are stored they interfere with the electrical current which 
		  in essence give such a module the data value of 0

		* flash memory is the amazing technology that allows for such compact storage
		  devices like sd cards
