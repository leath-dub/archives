# Question a

a) which would you prefer to buy if you had €50 to spend - a solid state
drive or a hard disk drive? Explain your answer.

__What I would choose__

For me personally it would be and SSD, more specifically a m.2 SSD.
Currently you can by upto 500gb m.2 SSDs for as low as €50. 

__Why__

There are many reasons why I would by an ssd over a hdd. First and 
formost m.2 ssds are small and compatible with my desktop and laptop.
This means that I can install a portable operating system onto it. This 
is important to me as and avid linux user. I like to use ssds to install
oses and test them on varies devices.

Secondly and more objectively, ssds, as the name implies are solid state
without any moving parts. In this way they are more quiet and draw less 
power. Aswell as this ssds load memory quicker, allowing for snappier 
start up of applications and boot times. Despite this when it comes 
downloading or uploading, the speed difference is less noticeable.

Thirdly ssds are more dureable than hdds. Hdds use platters, that store
bits as magnetic fields. For these fields to be read and written the
read/write head must be nano meters from the surface of the platter. In
this way, along with their mechanical nature, they are more fragile and 
less shock resistent than ssds. This is important in a laptop or any 
portable device, as in the event of a drop your more likely to be able
to recover the data in the device.

The main disadvantage I see to ssds is their limited write cycles. This 
is due to damage done to the floating gates that store bits. Over time 
this damage reduces the ssds efectiveness at storing electrons. Ultimately
ssds are more likely to fail by degrading over time and hdds are more 
likely to fail by a mechanical fault.

# Question b

b) What was your favourite part of the module? why?

Personally I am fasinated by CPU, logic gates and sequential logic.
Although I had covered logic before in maths, it was interesting to see a 
more computer oriented extension of that.

Specifically I found the karnaugh maps, logic gates, flip-flops and adders
very interesting as they gave a glimpse into low level operations of a computer.
I find it enlightening understanding the interenal structure of the ALU
and memory. The more I learn about how computations are processed, the 
more I appreciate the careful abstraction a os provides. 

# Question c

c) What was you least favourite part of the module? why?

To be honest I have little complaints about the module. However I have
a few points to touch on. 

* Sometimes things could feel over explained to the point of boredom

* It was often that the quizes had errors in them. Although these errors
were resolved after the fact, it made me question myself in the tests
and put me off quite a bit.

The only other critique I have is that I felt like it may have been nice
to have the hardware on view(possibly so we could have a closer look at 
the end on the lecture).
