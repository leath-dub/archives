Predicate logic:

	Propositional logic with variables(predicate is a prop. without a defined variable)

		-A predicate is a object of a variable, one that can also
		relate multiple variables , e.g p(x), p(x, y)

		-The predicate can constrict the given variable/s range
		e.g p(x): x is an int
		hence x is an element of the integer set
		
		*in essence a proposition can be thought of as something that is true
		or false and a predicate can be thought of as something that is either
		true or false bounded by the value assigned to the variable involved* 
		
		-Universal statement -> "for all x"
		-Existential statement -> "there exists x such that"

		*when a variable is bound by a quantifier ( like those above ) the 
		statement is no longer considered a predicate, rather a proposition 
		as it no longer accepts a variable purely as input*
		
		Domain of discourse (D) set of objects that can be substituted for a
		variable
~q(x) and q(x) # example of a prop. formed by predicates
quantifiers => "for all", "there exists", ie they restrict the variable's range
the use of constants only in a statement, means that the statement can not be a predicate
