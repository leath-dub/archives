### 1. Context
</font>
<font size="4">
My first interaction with my group members was after my absence from our first assignment. This, as you can imagine, was my first impression on them. A person that is inactive in the 
course and ignorant to prior instructions about daily email reading. In light of this discrepancy, I had a "wake up call" from the start, which led me to change very quickly. 
Naturally I was quick to contact my group members and even set up a more appropriate communication platform.

Ignoring that initial hiccup I think that I sufficiently contributed to the group across the assignments/assessments. Although I feel as though I could have approached things in a much 
better way and practiced in-action reflection throughout. As well as this myself, and group included, did not follow or fit into allocated group roles as we would have hoped .This 
led to poor planning of our assignments and not enough communication and clear distribution of work.

### 2. Continue
</font>
<font size="4">
Throughout my interactions with my group members, especially those involving problem solving, I made it my
personal duty to understand each group members points of view. I filled, partly the role of sceptic in not blindly accepting group members answers, this ensured that myself and other
group members could all agree on solutions before we submitted answers. I also tried my best to regularly update the group over text and check up on how people were doing, this was 
especially pertinent for the week 5 lab task when we had to compose seperately written pieces into a concise document. 

I found that I could consistently simplify and concretise problems with little hesitation, which allowed for better understanding of problems. I will continue to be polite and friendly, whilst still making my 
opinions and standpoints clear and ensuring that my voice and the voices of the other group members are heard. I should also continue to draw my points on paper to aid in the 
other members understanding as I found when trying to demonstrate solutions to problems, my purely vocal approach would disengage my group members.

### 3. Stop
</font>
<font size="4">
It is clear to myself that my approach has been objectively flawed at times. I have to stop being impulsive about problems and taking my first reading as sufficient understanding of 
a problem/task. I need to stop rushing the problem solving process, that is, making large leaps in problems without outlining each step of the process. When doing problems out, my
sheet of paper is as convoluted as my thoughts and only serves to confuse myself and my group members. It is often that I catch my mistake very late due to the lack of clarity of my
steps.

### 4. Start
</font>
<font size="4">
There are many ideas I have and need to implement into future group projects, as well as personal projects. These include taking a more step by step process to solving problems, this 
allows you to backtrack and refer to previous strategies. In the week 4 lab task we had to complete 2 problems, I found myself in a fixed position in regards to one of the
problems and found it hard to explore more creative perspectives on the problem. Going forward I will try to avoid such a situation by following the aspects of  
a problem solving grid that demonstrates each step of the solving process. It is clear that by skipping steps and not following some logical progression I was brought to such a fixed state.
likewise I need to practice in-action reflection when I hit a block like this or when confusion arises amongst group members. 

Another thing I need to do is get to know my group members better, our interactions although quite friendly can feel purely driven by the task at hand. Although it is alright to be 
worried about the task, it is also important that all of the group members are comfortable amongst each other. Similarly, I have to start communicating with my group members more often
about workload and how we should divide work, lack of clarity is probably the cause of minimal communication between my group members and I.

### Final thoughts
</font>
<font size="4">
The important take away I have found is that reflection is key to development. I also should not limit this to looking back on group assignments, self development is something I 
will incorporate into other areas of my life, like programming, exercise and social interactions. I want to get a better understanding of my actual strengths and weaknesses and 
how to counteract them with good methodology and a solid thought process.
