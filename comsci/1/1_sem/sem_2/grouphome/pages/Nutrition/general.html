                This article will give you a general guide on what foods you should be eating. I will not go through a formal diet or set of recipes in this article. If you wish to look into some healthy diets that suit your needs I recommend you check out this section of our website( link to other group member's website )
                </p>
                <p class="pt">
                The focus of this article is to talk on the kinds of food we should try to avoid and those foods we should eat more of. In general we want to reduce the amount of sugars, saturated fats and trans fats.

                    <h2>Types of Food</h2>
                    The human diet is comprised of 3 main food types:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="pt">Fats</li>
                        <li class="pt">Proteins( for growth, repair and building muscle )</li>
                        <li class="pt">Carbohydrates( including, monosaccarides(sugars) --Quick release energy, polysaccarides(e.g starch) --Slower release energy )</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p class="pt" style="font-style: italic">NOTE: Your body stores energy as glycogen, temporarily in your cells, any of this that is not used up is converted to fat
                </p>
                <hr class="my-5">
                <h2>Avoid fats</h2>
                <p class="pt">
                There are different types of fat, some unhealthier than others. Unsaturated fats are mainly found in plant based food and you shouldn't worry much at all consuming these, so long as you are not eating too many calories. It is saturated fats( found in meat produce) and trans-fats, found in processed foods, that you need to avoid at all costs. Trans-fats especially as they have been proven to increase persons risk of heart problems and cancer of any kind. 
                </p>
                <p class="pt">
                Be sure to read the labels of any food you are buying and ensure that there is a minimal amount of trans-fats/trans-fatty acids. In this way you should, if not completely, severely reduce the amount of processed foods in your diet. The <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet" target="_blank">WHO</a> recommends you to keep Fat intake at 30% of total calories in your diet, 10% being saturated fats and 1% trans-fats.

                <h2>Proteins</h2>
                <p class="pt">
                These days in first world countries protein is so easy and cheap to come by. According to Daniel Pendick, who wrote a blog on harvards website
                the average american diet consists of 16% protein, 6% higher than the recommended. Although there is not enough evidence to suggest high protein
                intake to be an issue, where you are getting the protein from could be more more cause for concern. Especially if you are eating high fat meats
                or even processed meats these can have a long term affect on your health, as discussed above when talking about fats.
                </p>
                <p>
                Reducing meat intake is also a step in the right direction anyway when it comes to the envirnmental effects of the meat
                industry.

                <h2>Carbs are Good</h2>
                <p class="pt">
                Carbohydrates, e.g starchy food(potatoes,pasta, etc) can be broken down to sugars in our bodies. It seems to be a fad of this time that carbohydrates are the enemy of people trying to lose weight. This is not the case and it is fats as previously mentioned that are the main cause of concern. Carbohydrates are essential to keep you going during the day. Despite this carbs are not all made equal, much like fats you should avoid highly processed carbohydrates and stick to whole foods, like oats, rice and barely as your main source of carbohydrates.                </p> 
                <p>
                Sugars are carbohydrates and the general guide is to limit intake of sweets and drinks that artificially add sugar.
                </p>
                <p class="pt" style="font-style: italic">
                My advice is to not cocern yourself much with carbohydrates and focus more on your fat and added sugar intake. Most importantly you should also have a diet that incorporates alot of fruit and vegatables
                </p>

                <h2>Harvard's Handy Food Plate</h2>
                <p class="pt">
                Harvard university have revamped the food pyramid to our modern standards of a healthy diet, as discussed above. Unsurprisingly Fruits and vegatables occupy 50% of the plate while protein( healthy ones that is ) occupy only 25% of the plate. Note the the glass of water and excercise, these are fundamental parts of being healthy along with what I have discussed.
