A terminal app for practicing typing 

        -Open source on github 
        -Fully offline and intially only with random words
        -Take with credit, monkeytypes word library
        -Basic statistics accessible through commands

    the premise of project = lightweight wpm practice envirnment for bash terminal 
    

    Main parameters/goals:
        
        -Basic 
        -prints a line of text to user and records input aswell as overall time to complete
        -if mistakes are found, those words are removed from wpm calculation
        
   Down the line goals:
        
        -more live recording of mistakes
        -better statistics 
        -possibly a mode that uses quotes or extracts aswell

   Things I need to look out for:
        
        -try not to extract from the main premise
        -try to keep as much together as possible
        -write good documention for anyone who wants to use it
