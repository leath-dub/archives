## Financials

### Growth Projections

+ __User base__

  We can expect around 1000 users within the first month based on the
  response we have gotten on social media pre-launch. Based on that
  we also predict steady growth to a user base of around 4500 in month
  6( assuming 750 people/month ).

  We also want to make sure users stay, so keeping the app fresh
  with news and interesting features is important to keep people using it.

+ __Bootstrapping__

  Provisionally we are following a bootstrapping business model. We will
  take the money we earn and invest in resources and/or advertisement. Though
  assessing growth monthly, we can ascertain whether are current server is
  bottlenecking our growth with the growth of the user base. We are willing
  to finance, be it personal funds or a bank loan, 
  the purchase of new servers if growth suits.

### Revenue Projections

+ __Advertisment__

  Running Google Adsense, at daily traffic of 1000 visits ~30000 visits per month
  according to: ( under content category of "People and Society" )

  ``https://www.google.com/adsense/start/#calculator``

  We could be looking at an annual revenue of €1055( ~€87/mnth ). Similarly based on growth
  projections after 6 months of user base 4500, under current ratio of daily visits we could expect a similar
  daily website traffic which gains an annual revenue of €4681( ~€390/mnth ).

  Running Google AdMob at a daily traffic of about 400 users ~12000 users per month
  according to: ( under content category of "Social" and device "Android" )

  ``https://admob.google.com/home/#calculator``

  We could be looking at an annual revenue of €157( ~€13/mnth ). Similarly to the website
  based on the ratio of daily traffic and user base (400/1000=4:10), at 6 months user base
  of 4500( daily traffic 1800 users ) that is €630 annually( ~€52/mnth ).

+ __Donations__

  On our site there is a donate plan to which users can subscribe to at €10/mnth
  as well as a one time "buy us a coffee" donation of 3€. The subscription allows
  elimination of advertisement on the app.

  Based on month 1 app traffic( 400 users/day  -> 1000 user base * 40% ), assuming 0.5% of people opt into a
  subscription and with 5 coffees/mnth( 1.25% ) thats 420€ annually( 35€/mnth )

  In 6 months time @1800 users/day we could be looking at 1872€ annually( 156€/mnth )

#### Expenses

+ __Application launch__

  Because our product is an app we have to consider the price of
  putting it on the app store. It will cost $99 per annum to put
  our app on the Apple store and a $25 one time fee to put it on
  the Google Play store.

  Taking this into consideration we have decided to not launch
  on the Apple store provisionally for 3 years while we test it's
  success on the Google Play store.

+ __Server__

  It should cost maximum €15/month to keep the server running. That
  is managing a database and backend for the app as well as our
  static website.

  The domain name ``www.vestigium.ie`` is available at an upfront cost
  of €2.99 at ``https://www.letshostbilling.com``

  Fortunately there is no upfront cost for the server as Cathal
  will host the services on a spare tower in his residence.

  _total upfront cost of(excluding monthly server fee): ~€26_

## Work Plan

### Goals

In the short term, being a group of students, we hope to steadily increase
user base to our projected 4500 users in 6 months time. There are three main
options we have based on our current position.

1. Invest in employees to manage the business while we can put focus to our
   studies

2. Sell the business once its administration becomes to much for our free time
   to handle

3. Based on success, consider dropping out to dedicate full attention to the
   business

Should we pick an option that involves us staying in the business, we should
prioritise and push our same ideals and ensure the message we convey does not
morph out of our original agenda.

### Hiring

As mentioned in Goals, it is one option we have considered, especially hiring of
an accountant and lawyer, to ensure we have proper accountants and have someone
at hand should we face legal issues.

Formal departments of the business will likely need establishment down the line
should we start employing a range of different people.

### Marketing

Advertisement will be a big part of our marketing, alongside social media
presence. We also rely on our strong message in rippling by peoples word,
taking in more and more users.

Advertisements and social media campaigns will be organised by the current
team( whom ever it suits most ). Though as alluded to in "Hiring", we
could open a separate department for that side of the business.
