Blogs 1 and 2
=============

_Cathal O'Grady_\

Blog 1
======

**Topic:**
What is your understanding of digital innovation? What do you hope to learn
during this course?

My understanding
----------------
To me innovation is about a new idea and ones drive in pursuing this idea with
the vision of a better world. It is easy to get functionally fixed, that is
seeing objects associated with their most common uses and innovation is an
escape from this and a building of a new concept. Due to this it is often that
a new set of eyes can induce a new perspective on older concepts and lead to
innovation.

To my knowledge in the tech world innovation often manifests itself in a
startup company in which one or a small group of entrepreneurs try to develop a
scalable business, backed by innovative technology. Unfortunately it's rare that
businesses make it past the startup phase let alone being highly profitable.
However every so often there is an idea so good as to bring a person
unimaginable wealth.

What I hope to learn
--------------------

I hope to learn a little more of the business side of technology. I am
interested in understanding how tech companies function and how it's all
managed.

As well as this I hope to be able to some what better articulate myself by the
end of the semester. Both the blogs and group project should do well by me in
this regard. Communication is always a good skill to hone in this field.

I also anticipate learning more about web design through the group project. I
learned a lot about websites last semester in the 'Web Design' module and It
will be nice to apply that outside of the module.

Overall I am looking forward to the module and what it might bring to the
table.

Blog 2
======

**Topic:** Choose a frequently updated blog that you like and write about it
including (i) why you like it; (ii) how you would categorise it; (iii) what it's
main focus is.

The Blog
--------
The youtube channel "Luke Smith" is one that I frequent and although he doesn't
upload as much as others might he has tonnes of content that I absorb and find
both helpful and informative.

Why I like it
-------------
Luke Smith, the owner of the channel, is somebody I consider highly rational and
down to earth. Though he spent much of his life studying linguistics he often
covers topics involving technology. I find his stance on modern technology very
refreshing and I am always engaged by his technical tutorials about gnu/linux.
He inspired me to ditch windows and use software that respects the rights of
it's users. Additionally he inspired me to start reading literature again and
use my free time more productively in general.

How I would categorise it
-------------------------
Though he criticises phones and social media he also makes great tutorials
about gnu/linux programs as well as discussing other aspects of technology. His
channel is very unique in his balance in promoting a calm rural life whilst
also developing software and appreciating technology. I would categorise his
channel under "Tech and life advice".

What it's main focus is
----------------------
The channels core focus is on education, educating people about free software,
technology and being a reasonable person. One video that stands out to me is
"Will you EVER stand up for yourself?", in this he discuses crucially the
importance of sticking to your principles as well as arguing the ultimate
livelihood being as self-dependant as possible. This video gives a taste of
Luke's morals, ones that follow closely to my own.
