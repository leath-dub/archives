### Growth Projections

### Expenses

+ Application launch

  Because our product is an app we have to consider the price of
  putting it on the app store. It will cost $99 per annum to put
  our app on the Apple store and $25 one time fee to put it on
  the Google Play store.

  Taking this into consideration we have decided to not launch
  on the Apple store provisionally for 3 years while we test it's
  success on the Google Play store.

+ Server

  It should cost maximum €15/month to keep the server running. That
  is managing a database and backend for the app aswell as our
  static website.

  The domain name `www.vestigium.ie` is available at an upfront cost
  of €2.99 at [link www.letshostbilling.com](https://www.letshostbilling.com)

  Fortunately there is no upfront cost for the server as Cathal
  will host the services on a spare tower in his residence.

_total upfront cost of(excluding monthly server fee): ~€26_
